# Mobile Manipulator Vision-Based Surgery Assistant
Name of your project

## Team Members and Roles
Tanay Patel - Implemented manipulator arm and compiled simulation

Mark Shetyn - Implemented robot vision and neural network

Charles Khan - Implemented mobile robot path planning and differential drive

Describe the roles and responsibilities of each member of your team. For example: Did they help with the
implementation of a certain component of the project? Did they analyze or run experiments on the
implementation to gather results or data? Did they help plot the data and write up the project description?


## Introduction
What is the motivation for choosing this problem? What ECSE275 robotics concepts are you exploring in
this problem? Summarize the final deliverable (i.e. what you will eventually demo)


## Approach
What are the main “building blocks” of your system? How did you implement each of them? Why did you
choose to implement them this way? How did the ECSE 275 concepts you learned inform your approach to
each part? What experiments did you conduct and what data did you gather to measure the performance
of the system or define success? Include a summary flow chart of how different components in your
implementation interface with each other. What messages or data is passed between components?


## Results
The results section should contain images of your final implementation, GIFs of some part of your system
in action. You should embed mp4 videos of your working implementation into the page by first
uploading it to YouTube. It should go over any quantitative data you might have gathered which can be
presented as a table, or a graphical plot. Also, talk about the performance qualitatively. Then discuss if
the implementation met the team’s pre-determined metrics of success. If it did, why was it successful? If it
did not, then what could have been done instead (offer some suggestions).


## Conclusion
Summarize what you did, and the result that you achieved. Discuss how the work can be further developed
or improved in the future.
